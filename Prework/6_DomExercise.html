<html>
  <body>
    Animals:
    <ol id="ol1">
      <li>Frog</li>
      <li>Dog</li>
      <li>Bunny</li>
    </ol>

    <div id="id1">
      <p>This is the text in div id1</p>
      <p>Hope you enjoy my HTML</p>
    </div>

    <p id="id2">Here's some text in a paragraph</p>

    <div class="myClass">I love learning about HTML and JavaScript</div>

    <p class="myClass">Coding is fun</p>

    <button id="button1">Button 1</button>
    <br /><br />
    <button id="button2">Button 2</button>
  </body>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Exercise 1: Select the element with id "id2" and change the text inside it to "Here's some new text"
    document.getElementById("id2").innerHTML = "Here's some new text.";

    // Exercise 2: Select the element with id "id1" and make the text inside it green.
    document.getElementById("id1").style.color = "green";

    // Exercise 3: Select the elements that have the class "myClass". console.log the output.
    let x = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");
    console.log(x);

    // Exercise 4: Select the children of the element with id "id1". console.log the output.
    let y = document.getElementById("id1").children;
    console.log(y);

    // Exercise 5: Select all list items on the page. console.log the output.
    let z = document.getElementsByTagName("li");
    console.log(z);

    // Exercise 6: Use JavaScript to find the *number* of list items on the page. console.log the output.
    let num = document.getElementById("ol1").childElementCount;
    console.log(num);

    // Exercise 7: Using JavaScript, create a list item and add it to the end of the ordered list.
    let node = document.createElement("li");
    let textnode = document.createTextNode("Fox");
    document.getElementById("ol1").appendChild(node);
    node.appendChild(textnode);

    // Exercise 8: Using JavaScript, make it so that when button1 is clicked,
    // an alert pops up saying "Hi from Techtonica".
    let buttonOne = document.getElementById("button1");
    buttonOne.addEventListener("click", function () {
      alert("Hi from Techtonica");
    });


    // Exercise 9: In your own words, write a few sentences explaining what the DOM is. Write your answer in a comment below:
    //The DOM is a tree structure of objects and each object corresponds to HTML elements, attributes, and text.

    // The next two exercises combine the DOM with other JavaScript you've learned. Try them for an extra challenge!

    // Exercise 10: Select the elements with the class "myClass" and update the text inside each of them to end with "!"
    // Hint: To operate on multiple elements, you can use a loop.
    let sentence = document.querySelectorAll(".myClass");

    sentence.forEach(sentence => {
      sentence.textContent += "!";
    });


    // Exercise 11: Make it so when the button2 is clicked,
    // the children of the element with id "id1" each have their text replaced with a random number 1-100
    
    let buttonTwo = document.getElementById("button2");
    let randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
    let parentElement = document.getElementById("id1");
    let childElements = parentElement.childNodes;
    buttonTwo.addEventListener("click", function () {
      childElements.forEach(childElements => {
        childElements.textContent = `${randomNum}`;
      })
    })


    // How was this exercise (easy, hard, fun, confusing)?
    // What references did you use to help?
    // Please put your answers in a comment below:
    // Some excercises were difficult. I used MDN, W3schools, and
    // other internet searching for some of them. I'm still struggling
    // with the last exercise and will update when finished.
